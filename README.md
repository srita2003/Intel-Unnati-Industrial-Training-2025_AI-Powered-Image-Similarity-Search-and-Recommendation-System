Fashion Lens is a deep learning–based image similarity search system that identifies and recommends visually similar fashion products without relying on manual tags or text descriptions. The system uses a Triplet Network architecture to learn semantic visual embeddings, enabling accurate similarity matching across large image datasets.

Key Features
1. Triplet Network–based deep learning model for visual similarity learning
2. Content-based image search using cosine similarity
3. Supports large-scale datasets (3000+ images)
4. Real-time image recommendation capability

Applications
1. E-commerce “Find Similar Products”
2. Fashion recommendation systems
3. Visual search in digital catalogs
   
Tech Stack
Languages & Libraries: Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Triplet Loss
Data Handling: Efficient batch processing for large datasets

Dataset
Curated fashion image dataset with over 3000 images of shoes, apparel, and accessories
Images were preprocessed and augmented to improve model performance

Performance
Training Loss: Gradually decreases over epochs, indicating the model effectively learns embeddings
Triplet evaluation accuracy: 97.5% (Anchor-Positive distance < Anchor-Negative distance)

Future improvements that may be possible include:
1. Continued tuning of the encoder on domain-specific datasets to further define accuracy. 
2. Utilization of large-scale indexing frameworks, such as FAISS, to support scale.
3. Development of a multi-modal search capability for image and text input to enhance user interaction.
