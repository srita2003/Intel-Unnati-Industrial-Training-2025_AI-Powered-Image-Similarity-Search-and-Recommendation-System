# Intel-Unnati-Industrial-Training-2025_AI-Powered-Image-Similarity-Search-and-Recommendation-System

Fashion Lens is a deep learning–based image similarity search system that identifies and recommends visually similar fashion products without relying on manual tags or text descriptions. The system uses a Triplet Network architecture to learn semantic visual embeddings, enabling accurate similarity matching across large image datasets.

Key Features

1. Triplet Network–based deep learning model for visual similarity learning
2. Content-based image search using cosine similarity
3. Supports large-scale datasets (3000+ images)
4. Real-time image recommendation capability

Applications
1. E-commerce “Find Similar Products”
2. Fashion recommendation systems
3. Visual search in digital catalogs

Tech Stack
Python, PyTorch, CNNs, Triplet Loss, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
